* How can this be done in a single traversal?

### 18. **Find if an Array is a Subarray of Another Array**

* Write a program to check if an array is a subarray of another array.
* How would you optimize this solution?

### 19. **Check if Two Arrays are Equal**

* Write a program to check if two arrays are equal (having the same length and elements).
* How would you compare arrays without using the `equals` method?

### 20. **Find the Missing Number in an Array**

* Write a program to find the missing number in a consecutive array of integers.
* How would you solve this problem in O(n) time complexity?

### 21. **Find the Product of All Elements Except the Current Element**

* Write a program to find the product of all elements in an array except the current element at each index.
* How would you implement this without using division?

### 22. **Move All Negative Numbers to One Side of the Array**

* Write a Java program to rearrange an array such that all negative numbers are on one side, and all positive numbers are on the other.
* How would you perform this operation without sorting the array?

### 23. **Find Pair with Given Sum in an Array**

* Write a program to find if there is a pair of elements in an array whose sum equals a given value.
* How can you solve this problem in O(n) time?

### 24. **Check if an Array is Sorted**
